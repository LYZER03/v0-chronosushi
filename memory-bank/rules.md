- After making any changes, ALWAYS start a new clean server instance so I can test it.
- Always kill any previously running related servers before starting a new one.
- Always prefer simple solutions — avoid over-engineering or unnecessary abstraction.
- Never create new code if an equivalent or similar implementation already exists.
- Iterate on existing patterns and code before considering introducing new ones.
- Follow the current project structure and conventions exactly. Do not deviate from existing folder organization, naming, patterns, or technologies unless explicitly instructed.
- Avoid duplicating logic or functionality — always check if similar code already exists.
- Your code must handle multiple environments properly: dev, test, and prod.
- Only make changes that are:
    - Explicitly requested
    - Clearly and directly related to the task
    - Confidently understood in terms of impact
- When fixing bugs:
    - Try to resolve them within the existing implementation
    - Do not introduce new technologies or patterns unless all existing options have been exhausted
- If you must change the implementation, remove the old logic to avoid duplication or drift
- Keep the codebase very clean, consistent, and organized
- Avoid writing one-off scripts in main files — isolate temporary or single-use logic
- No file should exceed 200–300 lines of code. Refactor and split as needed.
- Mocking or stubbing is allowed ONLY in test files — never in dev or production code.
- Do not overwrite or modify the .env file without asking for and receiving explicit permission.
- Stay laser-focused on only the areas of code relevant to the current task.
- Do not touch unrelated parts of the application.
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality or complex logic.
- Do not make major architectural or pattern changes to working features unless you are explicitly told to.
- Always think about the side effects and dependencies of your changes — what other parts of the codebase might be impacted?
