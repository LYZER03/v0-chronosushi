## Technical Implementation Details

### Page Builder
1. **Section Registry**
   - Central registry of available sections
   - Section metadata and configuration
   - Validation schemas

2. **State Management**
   - Page state with sections
   - Selection and focus management
   - History for undo/redo

3. **Rendering**
   - Server components for initial render
   - Client components for interactivity
   - Preview mode

### Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- Example of potential schema additions
CREATE TABLE sections (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  type TEXT NOT NULL,
  config JSONB NOT NULL,
  page_id UUID REFERENCES pages(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  sort_order INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_sections_page_id ON sections(page_id);
```

### API Endpoints

#### Pages API
- `GET /api/pages` - List all pages
- `POST /api/pages` - Create new page
- `GET /api/pages/[id]` - Get page by ID
- `PUT /api/pages/[id]` - Update page
- `DELETE /api/pages/[id]` - Delete page
- `POST /api/pages/[id]/publish` - Publish page

#### Sections API
- `GET /api/pages/[id]/sections` - Get page sections
- `POST /api/pages/[id]/sections` - Add section
- `PUT /api/sections/[id]` - Update section
- `DELETE /api/sections/[id]` - Remove section
- `POST /api/sections/reorder` - Update section order

## Testing Strategy
